## Project Overview
This is a simple static website with jokes and a blog, deployed on Vercel. The website features:
- Random joke display with interactive elements
- Blog functionality with markdown support
- Responsive design with CSS animations

## Project Structure
```

├── index.html           # Main website with jokes
├── blog/                # Blog section
│   ├── index.html       # Blog listing page
│   ├── blog-post.js     # Web component for rendering markdown posts
│   └── post-1.md        # Sample blog post in markdown

```

## Technologies Used
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript for frontend
- Web Components for blog post rendering
- Markdown for blog content
- Vercel for deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Development
To start development server:
```bash
make dev
```
This will start a local server on port 4200.

## Deployment
The site is deployed on Vercel with the following configuration:
- Uses vercel-rust runtime for API functions (though no Rust files currently exist)
- Custom domain configured via CNAME file

## Key Features
1. **Jokes Page**:
   - Random joke display on page load
   - Possum image that changes on each load
   - Interactive elements with CSS animations

2. **Blog System**:
   - Custom web component `<blog-post>` for rendering markdown
   - Markdown parsing with marked.js library
   - Hash-based routing for blog posts

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Joke
1. Edit `index.html`
2. Add new entry to the `jokes` array in the JavaScript section

### Adding a New Blog Post
1. Create a new markdown file in the `blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter metadata (title, date, author, tags)
3. Add content in markdown format
4. Update `blog/index.html` to include a link to the new post

### Adding New Images
1. Add image files to the root directory
2. Update the `swapImage()` function in `index.html` to include the new image in the rotation

### Modifying Styles
1. Edit CSS styles in the `<style>` section of the relevant HTML file
2. For blog styles, modify the CSS in `blog/index.html` or `blog/blog-post.js`

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- The project has a Rust runtime configured in `vercel.json` but no Rust files exist
- There's a shell script (`blah.sh`) with API keys that should be removed or secured
- Resume is duplicated in both markdown and HTML formats

## Future Improvements
- Add actual API functionality with Rust backend
- Implement proper image loading for the jokes section
- Add more blog posts and improve blog navigation
- Implement proper SEO tags
- Add analytics or monitoring
